All artwork, music, and sound effects in the game are original.

The artwork was made using Krita. All artwork is credited to Thomas Greaney and Paulis Gributs.

All music and sound effects are credited to Thomas Greaney.

The music and sound effects were created by live recording of a Korg minilogue subtractive synthesizer, a Korg Volca FM synthesizer,
and a PRS SE Custom 22 using a VoxAC15X amplifier. The guiatr amp is recorded with a Shure SM57 mic into a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 
audio interface, the synthesizers were recorded directly by the audio interface. Multiple recordings were put together using 
the Ableton Live 10 Lite Digital Audio Workstation.

The only non-original asset in the game is the font in the UI, which is royalty free, and a license is included in the com \ponywolf folder.
