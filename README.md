ASSETS


All artwork, music, and sound effects in the game are original, with the exception of one sound effect.

The artwork was made using Krita. All artwork is credited to Thomas Greaney and Paulis Gributs.

All music and sound effects are credited to Thomas Greaney, apart from the chicken Sound effect.

The music and sound effects were created by live recording of a Korg minilogue subtractive synthesizer, a Korg Volca FM synthesizer, and a PRS SE Custom 22 using a VoxAC15C1X amplifier. The guiatr amp is recorded with a Shure SM57 mic into a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2  audio interface, the synthesizers were recorded directly by the audio interface. Multiple recordings were put together using  the Ableton Live 10 Lite Digital Audio Workstation.

The only non-original assets in the game are the chicken sound effect and the font in the UI. Both assets are royalty free. A license for the font  is in the com folder. Here is a link to the chicken sound effect: http://www.orangefreesounds.com/clucking-chicken/ Here is a link to the license  type the sound effect is under: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ . The sound effect was sampled and reverb and distortion were added to it to make it sound more zombie-like.

OBJECTIVE


The objective of the game is to survive as long as you can, and to protect your coops from the zombie chickens. Points are awarded at the end of each game for how long the player survived, as well as for the number of coops remaining undestroyed. Game Over is when the Player loses all of their health, or else when all of the coops in the levels they have access to are destroyed. Hint: In level 4, you can shoot eggs over lava to ignite them. An ignited egg will explode on impact with an enemy, dealing an area effect of damage to nearby enemies.
